#summary Architecture of the project
#labels Featured,Phase-Design,UML

The idea was to keep the subsystems small, low coupled and testable.
But following the rule that:
 a picture says a million words.

I have created the demonstration discussing the architecture on canvas of the UML diagrams. So check up:
  * The use case diagram for project functional requirements
  * The deployment diagram for deployment details
  * Sequence diagrams describing realization of the proposed use cases
  * Class diagrams for layering and internal infrastructure
  * Collaboration Diagrams for the algorithm descriptions
